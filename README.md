# Tribot Project
This repository focuses on building a versatile robot equipped with tri-spoke wheels, capable of climbing stairs, navigating obstacles, and shooting projectiles.

## About the Project
This project aims to develop a comprehensive robotic system that can overcome various physical obstacles such as stairs and bricks using tri-spoke wheels. The robot is also equipped with a shooting mechanism and is controlled using a Flysky remote. The construction involves the use of pipes, 3D-printed components, and various electronic parts.
